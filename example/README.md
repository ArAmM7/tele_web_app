Example of WebApp in Telegram with Flutter.

You can find the code of the telegram bot used in this [example here](https://github.com/yeikel16/flutter-webapp-bot).

---
To test this example with your own telegram bot, follow these steps:

1. Run the `flutter pub get` command
2. Run the `flutter build web` command
3. Deploy in some hosting (GitHub Page, Netlify, Vercel) the folder located in `build/web`.
4. Once the project is deployed, obtain the URL
5. In your bot you must change the value of the variable `link_webapp` with your URL
6. Once your bot is activated, you can do it from Telegram to your WebApp in Flutter ðŸ˜Ž
